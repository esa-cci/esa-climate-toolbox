    This data store represents the [ESA CCI Open Data Portal](http://cci.esa.int/data)
    in the CCI Toolbox. It currently provides all CCI data that are published through
    an OpenSearch interface. The store will be extended to also provide TIFF

cci-zarr-store:
  store_id: "esa-cdc-zarr"
  title: "CCI Zarr Store (experimental)"
  description: >
    A data store that contains selected datasets from the CCI Open Data Portal
    which have been converted to [Zarr format](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/)
    and placed in [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk/) Object Storage.
    Its datasets are expected to offer a much better access performance compared to the
    CCI Open Data Portal Store that uses OPeNDAP as data transport protocol.
    It is planned to further develop the CCI Zarr Store and extend it successively.

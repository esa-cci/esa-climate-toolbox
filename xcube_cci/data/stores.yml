    This data store represents the [ESA CCI Open Data Portal](http://cci.esa.int/data)
    in the CCI Toolbox. It currently provides all CCI data that are published through
    an OpenSearch interface. The store will be extended to also provide TIFF
    and Shapefile Data.

  title: "CCI Zarr Store (experimental)"
  description: >
    A data store that contains selected datasets from the CCI Open Data Portal
    which have been converted to [Zarr format](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/)
    and placed in [JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk/) Object Storage.
    Its datasets are expected to offer a much better access performance compared to the
    CCI Open Data Portal Store that uses OPeNDAP as data transport protocol.
    It is planned to further develop the CCI Zarr Store and extend it successively.

  description: >
    Some datasets offered by the Open Data Portal are provided via 
    [references format](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/spec.html) 
    as specified by the [kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/) 
    package. This allows accessing to the original NetCDF data files with 
    an I/O performance comparable to [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/).

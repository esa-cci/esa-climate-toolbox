Quick Start
============

After executing the instructions given in :doc:`installation_guide` the ESA CCI
Toolbox is ready to use.
To show how to make first steps, a variety of notebooks has been compiled.
You may find them in the `notebooks` section in the `Github Repository`_, but
we have also assembled them here to provide you with an overview.

ESA CCI Toolbox Notebooks Setup
===============================
Before using Jupyter Lab for the first time install the :code:`jupyterlab` and
:code:`jupyterlab-geojson` packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    (ect) conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab jupyterlab-geojson

Start Jupyter Lab:
